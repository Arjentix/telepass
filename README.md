# Telepass

Self-hosted password manager for *Telegram* fully written in **Rust** ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€!

This implementation accepts only one user. The idea is that all this data is very sensitive and should be hosted by users.

## Micro-services

Non-exhaustive list, because it's currently on active development

- [`Password Storage`](password_storage/README.md) â€“ Storage for all user passwords
- [`Telegram Gate`](telegram_gate/README.md) â€“ Node to interact with `Telegram` using bots API

## Deployment

### TLS certificates configuration

#### Quick start

```bash
./scripts/gen_certs.sh
```

#### Manual configuration

If you're familiar with TLS and how to create your own certificates then the required files are:

```
certs
â”œâ”€â”€ password_storage.crt
â”œâ”€â”€ password_storage.key
â”œâ”€â”€ root_ca.crt
â”œâ”€â”€ telegram_gate.crt
â””â”€â”€ telegram_gate.key
```

Use `scripts/gen_certs.sh` as a reference if you have any problems.
